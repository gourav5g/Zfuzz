# Zfuzz - A Powerful Fuzzing and Penetration Testing Tool

**Zfuzz** is a powerful **Go**-based tool for security professionals designed to assist in **web application security testing**. It allows you to perform **fuzzing**, **API penetration testing**, and **OTP bypass** tests to identify vulnerabilities in target web applications or APIs.

## Features

### 1. **Advanced Fuzzing**
   - Fuzz web applications by replacing URL parameters with values from a wordlist.
   - Support for **GET**, **POST**, and **PUT** HTTP methods.
   - Customizable **timeout** configuration for each request.
   - Multiple **concurrent threads** to speed up the fuzzing process.

### 2. **OTP Bypass Simulation**
   - Simulates brute-forcing of **OTP-based authentication** mechanisms.
   - Allows you to test common OTP patterns and see if the system is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
   - Supports pattern-based OTP bypass (e.g., `123456`, `000001`, etc.).

### 3. **API Penetration Testing**
   - Test APIs for common security vulnerabilities such as **authentication bypass**, **rate-limiting**, and **input validation**.
   - **Token-based authentication** support (Bearer tokens).
   - Works with **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** HTTP methods for testing different endpoints.
   - Helps identify insecure APIs and issues with the security of your backend systems.

### 4. **Customizable Output**
   - Save results in **CSV** or **JSON** format for later analysis or reporting.
   - Detailed output showing the status of each request.
   - Colors for different HTTP status codes to make analysis easier.

### 5. **Detailed Reports**
   - Logs responses and status codes for each request.
   - Save output to a CSV or JSON file for further review.

## Installation

     sudo apt install golang -y
     ```
   - Verify Go installation:
     ```bash
     go version
     ```

### 2. **Clone the Repository**
